####Android Altimeter featuring a clean interface and easy calibration

## Project Details
Hiking Altimeter is mainly used as a practice to apply what I am currently learning about Android.

Heavily inspired by Android Clean Architecture as demonstrated [here](https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture) and MVP.

Essentially, there are 4 layers:

1. Views
2. Presenters
3. Business Logic
4. Data

Each layer should be decoupled from each other and modular with minimal Android framework coupling in anything but Views.

## Coming soon...
+ Altitude tracking and fancy graphs
+ UI Refresh
+ Additional UI customization
+ Optional notifications (altitude alert)
